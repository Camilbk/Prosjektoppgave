abstract = {This is the second edition of a well-received book providing the fundamentals of the theory hyperbolic conservation laws. Several chapters have been rewritten, new material has been added, in particular, a chapter on space dependent flux functions, and the detailed solution of the Riemann problem for the Euler equations. Hyperbolic conservation laws are central in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and in science and technology. The reader is given a self-contained presentation using front tracking, which is also a numerical method. The multidimensional scalar case and the case of systems on the line are treated in detail. A chapter on finite differences is included. From the reviews of the first edition: "It is already one of the few best digests on this topic. The present book is an excellent compromise between theory and practice. Students will appreciate the lively and accurate style." D. Serre, MathSciNet  "I have read the book with great pleasure, and I can recommend it to experts as well as students. It can also be used for reliable and very exciting basis for a one-semester graduate course." S. Noelle, Book review, German Math. Soc. "Making it an ideal first book for the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations...an excellent reference for a graduate course on nonlinear conservation laws." M. Laforest, Comp. Phys. Comm.},

@misc{VerhulstFerdinand1990NDEa,
series = {Universitext},
abstract = {On the subject of differential equations a great many elementary books have been written. This book bridges the gap between elementary courses and the research literature. The basic concepts necessary to study differential equations - critical points and equilibrium, periodic solutions, invariant sets and invariant manifolds - are discussed. Stability theory is developed starting with linearisation methods going back to Lyapunov and Poincaré. The global direct method is then discussed. To obtain more quantitative information the Poincaré-Lindstedt method is introduced to approximate periodic solutions while at the same time proving existence by the implicit function theorem. The method of averaging is introduced as a general approximation-normalisation method. The last four chapters introduce the reader to relaxation oscillations, bifurcation theory, centre manifolds, chaos in mappings and differential equations, Hamiltonian systems (recurrence, invariant tori, periodic solutions). The book presents the subject material from both the qualitative and the quantitative point of view. There are many examples to illustrate the theory and the reader should be able to start doing research after studying this book.},
