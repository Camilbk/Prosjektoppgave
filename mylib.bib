abstract = {This is the second edition of a well-received book providing the fundamentals of the theory hyperbolic conservation laws. Several chapters have been rewritten, new material has been added, in particular, a chapter on space dependent flux functions, and the detailed solution of the Riemann problem for the Euler equations. Hyperbolic conservation laws are central in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and in science and technology. The reader is given a self-contained presentation using front tracking, which is also a numerical method. The multidimensional scalar case and the case of systems on the line are treated in detail. A chapter on finite differences is included. From the reviews of the first edition: "It is already one of the few best digests on this topic. The present book is an excellent compromise between theory and practice. Students will appreciate the lively and accurate style." D. Serre, MathSciNet  "I have read the book with great pleasure, and I can recommend it to experts as well as students. It can also be used for reliable and very exciting basis for a one-semester graduate course." S. Noelle, Book review, German Math. Soc. "Making it an ideal first book for the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations...an excellent reference for a graduate course on nonlinear conservation laws." M. Laforest, Comp. Phys.

abstract = {On the subject of differential equations a great many elementary books have been written. This book bridges the gap between elementary courses and the research literature. The basic concepts necessary to study differential equations - critical points and equilibrium, periodic solutions, invariant sets and invariant manifolds - are discussed. Stability theory is developed starting with linearisation methods going back to Lyapunov and Poincaré. The global direct method is then discussed. To obtain more quantitative information the Poincaré-Lindstedt method is introduced to approximate periodic solutions while at the same time proving existence by the implicit function theorem. The method of averaging is introduced as a general approximation-normalisation method. The last four chapters introduce the reader to relaxation oscillations, bifurcation theory, centre manifolds, chaos in mappings and differential equations, Hamiltonian systems (recurrence, invariant tori, periodic solutions). The book presents the subject material from both the qualitative and the quantitative point of view. There are many examples to illustrate the theory and the reader should be able to start doing research after studying this book.},

 abstract = {This paper uses the method of kinematic waves, developed in part I, but may be read independently. A functional relationship between flow and concentration for traffic on crowded arterial roads has been postulated for some time, and has experimental backing (§2). From this a theory of the propagation of changes in traffic distribution along these roads may be deduced (§§2, 3). The theory is applied (§4) to the problem of estimating how a 'hump', or region of increased concentration, will move along a crowded main road. It is suggested that it will move slightly slower than the mean vehicle speed, and that vehicles passing through it will have to reduce speed rather suddenly (at a 'shock wave') on entering it, but can increase speed again only very gradually as they leave it. The hump gradually spreads out along the road, and the time scale of this process is estimated. The behaviour of such a hump on entering a bottleneck, which is too narrow to admit the increased flow, is studied (§5), and methods are obtained for estimating the extent and duration of the resulting hold-up. The theory is applicable principally to traffic behaviour over a long stretch of road, but the paper concludes (§6) with a discussion of its relevance to problems of flow near junctions, including a discussion of the starting flow at a controlled junction. In the introductory sections 1 and 2, we have included some elementary material on the quantitative study of traffic flow for the benefit of scientific readers unfamiliar with the subject.},

From the analytical point of view, this is a first example of a well posedness result for conservation laws developing phase transitions, which is independent from the number of phase boundaries in the initial data or in the solutions. We consider below the Cauchy problem as well as the problem with boundaries.}

abstract = {It is shown that all the phase transitions in and out of freely flowing traffic reported earlier for a German site could be caused by bottlenecks, as are all the transitions observed at two other sites examined here. The evidence suggests that bottlenecks cause these transitions in a predictable way, and does not suggest that stoppages (jams) appear spontaneously in free flow traffic for no apparent reason. It is also shown that many of the complicated instability phenomena observed at all locations can be explained qualitatively in terms of a simple Markovian theory specific to traffic that does not necssarily include spontaneous transitions into the queued state as a feature.}
